    <li>we achieved all requirements.</li>
    <li>we collaborated together throughout the process.</li>
    <li>we went farther and began to use lists inside table and use nested lists to display our information and also placed our images into nested lists as well.</li>
    <li>On picture page and description page, both top and bottom have links to reture to other page, which makes user more convinient that don't need to screw down all the way to the bottom to change page.</li>
    <li>Devide page into parts by horizontal lines, which makes the page looks more organized.</li>
    <li>We used Atom and Github together to make our collaboration more effective.</li>
